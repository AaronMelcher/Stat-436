```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tsibble)
library(feasts)
library(tsibbledata)

spotify = read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/hvplyr3jy6vbt7s80lqgfx81ai4hdl0q.csv")
```

Part A
```{r}
spotify_tsibble = as_tibble(spotify, index="date", key="region")
spotify_tsibble
```

Part B
```{r}
global_tsibble <- spotify_tsibble |>
  filter(region=="global")

#gg_season(as_tibble(global_tsibble), period = "month", pal = streams)
```

Struggled with determining what error was occurring when trying to create the gg_season plot. unsure what the root cause is - possible something to do with the type of data object im trying to use
