# Homework 2 Portfolio Assignment - Ballon d'Or Rankings Analysis

## 1. Project Overview
I chose to focus on a rankings dataset of the Ballon d'Or award, which has been given to the best men's soccer player in the world since 1956.
Soccer is one of my favorite sports and I wanted to do a deeper dive into the award that is given out the best player each year.

## 2. Interesting Facts Learned Through Visualization
- **Key Insights:**
  - I learned that a majority of votes are only given out to the top 5 players recieving votes
  - Discovered that most winners only recieve around 25-30% of the total votes
  - That some players like Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have dominated the award for their country
  
- **Unexpected Finding:**
  - I learned that some countries that no longer exist have multiple award recipiants. Found this be quite interesting since I didn't really know the history of the award before the 2000s.

## 3. Interface Creation and Data Preparation
- **Data Sources and Preparation:**
  - I found my dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/ballon-dor-voting-history)
  - The provided data had some missing data in the entries from 2010 to 2015 when FIFA paired with magazine *France Football* to combine the Ballon d'Or and FIFA Best Men's Player Awards
  - This discovery had me focus on points share by rank and wins by nationality since this was data available in all rows
  - The original dataset also only had ranking data up to 2018 so I had to self add the top 5 ranked players and their associated data from 2019 to 2023. 2020 is not included as the award was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic

- **Interface Creation Process:**
  - Describe the tools, libraries, and technologies used to create the interface (e.g., Plotly, D3.js, Dash, etc.).
  - Discuss any choices made in terms of the interaction and user experience of the interface.

- **Style Customizations and Layout:**
  - Explain what guided your decisions in terms of style (color schemes, fonts, chart types) and interface layout.
  - Mention if the style choices were influenced by user accessibility, aesthetics, or consistency with branding.
  - If applicable, describe the reasons for choosing specific visualization types (bar chart, scatter plot, etc.).

## 4. Reactive Graph Structure
- **Explanation of Reactive Graph:**
  - Provide a detailed description of the reactive structure of your visualization. How do user interactions (e.g., clicks, dropdowns, sliders) influence the data being displayed?
  - Mention any frameworks or libraries used to implement reactivity (such as React, Vue.js, Shiny, Dash, etc.).

- **Data-Driven Updates:**
  - Explain how data updates dynamically in response to user actions.
  - If applicable, describe how multiple graphs are linked reactively (e.g., selecting a data point on one graph filters another).

## 5. Conclusion
Summarize the overall contribution of the visualization. Mention any future improvements or additional features that could be added to enhance its usability or insights.

## 6. How to Run the Project (Optional)
- Provide instructions on how to install dependencies and run the application locally, if applicable.
